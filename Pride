MR. O
Bennet B-Person
was O
among O
the O
earliest O
of O
those O
who O
waited O
on O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
. O

He O
had O
always O
intended O
to O
visit O
him, O

though O
to O
the O
last O
always O
assuring O
his O
wife O
that O
he O
should O
not O
go; O

and O
till O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
visit O
was O
paid, O
she O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
it. O

It O
was O
then O
disclosed O
in O
the O
following O
manner. O

Observing O
his O
second O
daughter O
employed O
in O
trimming O
a O
hat, O

he O
suddenly O
addressed O
her O
with, O

"I O
hope O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
will O
like O
it, O
Lizzy B-Person
." O

"We O
are O
not O
in O
a O
way O
to O
know O
what O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
likes," O

said O
her O
mother O
resentfully, O
"since O
we O
are O
not O
to O
visit." O

"But O
you O
forget, O
mama," O
said O
Elizabeth, O
"that O
we O
shall O
meet O
him O
at O
the O
assemblies, O

and O
that O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
has O
promised O
to O
introduce O
him." O

"I O
do O
not O
believe O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
will O
do O
any O
such O
thing. O

She O
has O
two O
nieces O
of O
her O
own. O
She O
is O
a O
selfish, O
hypocritical O
woman, O

and O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
of O
her." O

"No O
more O
have O
I," O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
; O
"and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
her O
serving O
you." O

Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
deigned O
not O
to O
make O
any O
reply; O

but O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself, O
began O
scolding O
one O
of O
her O
daughters. O

"Don't O
keep O
coughing O
so, O
Kitty B-Person
, O
for O
heaven's O
sake! O
Have O
a O
little O
compassion O
on O
my O
nerves. O
You O
tear O
them O
to O
pieces." O

" O
Kitty B-Person
has O
no O
discretion O
in O
her O
coughs," O
said O
her O
father; O
"she O
times O
them O
ill." O

"I O
do O
not O
cough O
for O
my O
own O
amusement," O
replied O
Kitty B-Person
fretfully. O

"When O
is O
your O
next O
ball O
to O
be, O
Lizzy B-Person
?" O

"To-morrow O
fortnight." O

"Aye, O
so O
it O
is," O
cried O
her O
mother, O
"and O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
does O
not O
come O
back O
till O
the O
day O
before; O
so O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
introduce O
him, O
for O
she O
will O
not O
know O
him O
herself." O

"Then, O
my O
dear, O
you O
may O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
your O
friend, O
and O
introduce O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
to O
her." O

"Impossible, O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
, O
impossible, O
when O
I O
am O
not O
acquainted O
with O
him O
myself; O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
teazing?" O

"I O
honour O
your O
circumspection. O

A O
fortnight's O
acquaintance O
is O
certainly O
very O
little. O

One O
cannot O
know O
what O
a O
man O
really O
is O
by O
the O
end O
of O
a O
fortnight. O
But O
if O
we O
do O
not O
venture, O

somebody O
else O
will; O
and O
after O
all, O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
and O
her O
nieces O
must O
stand O
their O
chance; O

and O
therefore, O
as O
she O
will O
think O
it O
an O
act O
of O
kindness, O

if O
you O
decline O
the O
office, O
I O
will O
take O
it O
on O
myself." O

The O
girls O
stared O
at O
their O
father. O

Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
said O
only, O
"Nonsense, O
nonsense!" O

"What O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
emphatic O
exclamation?" O
cried O
he. O

"Do O
you O
consider O
the O
forms O
of O
introduction, O
and O
the O
stress O
that O
is O
laid O
on O
them, O
as O
nonsense? O

I O
cannot O
quite O
agree O
with O
you O
there. O
What O
say O
you, O
Mary B-Person
? O

for O
you O
are O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
deep O
reflection O
I O
know, O
and O
read O
great O
books, O
and O
make O
extracts." O

Mary B-Person
wished O
to O
say O
something O
very O
sensible, O
but O
knew O
not O
how. O

"While O
Mary B-Person
is O
adjusting O
her O
ideas," O
he O
continued, O
"let O
us O
return O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
." O

"I O
am O
sick O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
," O
cried O
his O
wife. O

"I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that; O
but O
why O
did O
not O
you O
tell O
me O
so O
before? O

If O
I O
had O
known O
as O
much O
this O
morning, O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
called O
on O
him. O

It O
is O
very O
unlucky; O

but O
as O
I O
have O
actually O
paid O
the O
visit, O
we O
cannot O
escape O
the O
acquaintance O
now." O

The O
astonishment O
of O
the O
ladies O
was O
just O
what O
he O
wished; O

that O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
perhaps O
surpassing O
the O
rest; O

though O
when O
the O
first O
tumult O
of O
joy O
was O
over, O

she O
began O
to O
declare O
that O
it O
was O
what O
she O
had O
expected O
all O
the O
while. O

"How O
good O
it O
was O
in O
you, O
my O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
! O

But O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
persuade O
you O
at O
last. O

I O
was O
sure O
you O
loved O
our O
girls O
too O
well O
to O
neglect O
such O
an O
acquaintance. O

Well, O
how O
pleased O
I O
am! O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a O
good O
joke, O
too, O

that O
you O
should O
have O
gone O
this O
morning, O
and O
never O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
till O
now." O

"Now, O
Kitty B-Person
, O
you O
may O
cough O
as O
much O
as O
you O
chuse," O

said O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
; O
and, O
as O
he O
spoke, O
he O
left O
the O
room, O
fatigued O
with O
the O
raptures O
of O
his O
wife. O

"What O
an O
excellent O
father O
you O
have, O
girls," O
said O
she, O

when O
the O
door O
was O
shut. O
"I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
you O
will O
ever O
make O
him O
amends O
for O
his O
kindness; O

or O
me O
either, O
for O
that O
matter. O
At O
our O
time O
of O
life, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
pleasant O
I O
can O
tell O
you, O

to O
be O
making O
new O
acquaintance O
every O
day; O

but O
for O
your O
sakes, O
we O
would O
do O
any O
thing. O
Lydia B-Person
, O
my O
love, O
though O
you O
are O
the O
youngest, O

I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
will O
dance O
with O
you O
at O
the O
next O
ball B-Misc
." O

"Oh!" O
said O
Lydia B-Person
stoutly, O

"I O
am O
not O
afraid; O
for O
though O
I O
am O
the O
youngest, O
I'm O
the O
tallest." O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
conjecturing O
how O
soon O
he O
would O
return O

Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
's O
visit, O
and O
determining O
when O
they O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
dinner. O


ELIZABETH B-Person
, O
as O
they O
drove O
along, O

watched O
for O
the O
first O
appearance O
of O
Pemberley B-Misc
Woods I-Misc
with O
some O
perturbation; O

and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
turned O
in O
at O
the O
lodge B-Misc
, O
her O
spirits O
were O
in O
a O
high O
flutter. O

The O
park B-Misc
was O
very O
large, O
and O
contained O
great O
variety O
of O
ground B-Misc
. O

They O
entered O
it O
in O
one O
of O
its O
lowest O
points, O
and O
drove O
for O
some O
time O
through O
a O
beautiful O
wood B-Misc
, O
stretching O
over O
a O
wide O
extent. O

Elizabeth B-Person
's O
mind O
was O
too O
full O
for O
conversation, O

but O
she O
saw O
and O
admired O
every O
remarkable O
spot O
and O
point O
of O
view. O

They O
gradually O
ascended O
for O
half O
a O
mile, O

and O
then O
found O
themselves O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
considerable O
eminence, O

where O
the O
wood B-Misc
ceased, O
and O
the O
eye O
was O
instantly O
caught O
by O
Pemberley B-Location
House I-Location
, O

situated O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
a O
valley B-Misc
, O
into O
which O
the O
road B-Misc
, O

with O
some O
abruptness, O
wound. O

It O
was O
a O
large, O
handsome, O
stone O
building B-Misc
, O
standing O
well O
on O
rising O
ground B-Misc
, O
and O
backed O
by O
a O
ridge O
of O
high O
wood B-Misc
y O
hills B-Misc
; O
-- O
and O
in O
front, O

a O
stream O
of O
some O
natural O
importance O
was O
swelled O
into O
greater, O

but O
without O
any O
artificial O
appearance. O
Its O
banks B-Misc
were O
neither O
formal, O
nor O
falsely O
adorned. O

Elizabeth B-Person
was O
delighted. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
place O
for O
which O
nature O
had O
done O
more, O

or O
where O
natural O
beauty O
had O
been O
so O
little O
counteracted O
by O
an O
awkward O
taste. O

They O
were O
all O
of O
them O
warm O
in O
their O
admiration; O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
she O
felt O
that O
to O
be O
mistress O
of O
Pemberley B-Location
might O
be O
something! O

They O
descended O
the O
hill B-Misc
, O
crossed O
the O
bridge B-Misc
, O
and O
drove O
to O
the O
door B-Misc
; O

and, O
while O
examining O
the O
nearer O
aspect O
of O
the O
house, O

all O
her O
apprehensions O
of O
meeting O
its O
owner O
returned. O

She O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
chambermaid O
had O
been O
mistaken. O

On O
applying O
to O
see O
the O
place, O
they O
were O
admitted O
into O
the O
hall B-Location
; O
and O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

as O
they O
waited O
for O
the O
housekeeper, O
had O
leisure O
to O
wonder O
at O
her O
being O
where O
she O
was. O

The O
housekeeper O
came; O
a O
respectable-looking, O
elderly O
woman, O
much O
less O
fine, O
and O
more O
civil, O

than O
she O
had O
any O
notion O
of O
finding O
her. O

They O
followed O
her O
into O
the O
dining B-Location
parlour I-Location
. O
It O
was O
a O
large, O
well-proportioned O
room, O

handsomely O
fitted O
up. O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
after O
slightly O
surveying O
it, O

went O
to O
a O
window B-Misc
to O
enjoy O
its O
prospect. O

The O
hill B-Misc
, O
crowned O
with O
wood B-Misc
, O
from O
which O
they O
had O
descended, O

receiving O
increased O
abruptness O
from O
the O
distance, O
was O
a O
beautiful O
object. O

Every O
disposition O
of O
the O
ground B-Misc
was O
good; O

and O
she O
looked O
on O
the O
whole O
scene O
-- O
the O
river B-Misc
, O

the O
trees B-Misc
scattered O
on O
its O
banks B-Misc
, O

and O
the O
winding O
of O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
could O
trace O
it O
-- O
with O
delight. O

As O
they O
passed O
into O
other O
rooms, O
these O
objects O
were O
taking O
different O
positions; O

but O
from O
every O
window B-Misc
there O
were O
beauties O
to O
be O
seen. O

The O
rooms O
were O
lofty O
and O
handsome, O

and O
their O
furniture O
suitable O
to O
the O
fortune O
of O
their O
proprietor; O

but O
Elizabeth B-Person
saw, O
with O
admiration O
of O
his O
taste, O

that O
it O
was O
neither O
gaudy O
nor O
uselessly O
fine; O

with O
less O
of O
splendor, O
and O
more O
real O
elegance, O
than O
the O
furniture O
of O
Rosings. O

"And O
of O
this O
place," O
thought O
she, O
"I O
might O
have O
been O
mistress! O

With O
these O
rooms O
I O
might O
now O
have O
been O
familiarly O
acquainted! O

Instead O
of O
viewing O
them O
as O
a O
stranger, O

I O
might O
have O
rejoiced O
in O
them O
as O
my O
own, O
and O
welcomed O
to O
them O
as O
visitors O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt. O

-- O
But O
no," O
-- O
recollecting O
herself, O
-- O
"that O
could O
never O
be: O

my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
would O
have O
been O
lost O
to O
me: O
I O
should O
not O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
invite O
them." O

This O
was O
a O
lucky O
recollection O
-- O
it O
saved O
her O
from O
something O
like O
regret. O

She O
longed O
to O
enquire O
of O
the O
housekeeper O
whether O
her O
master O
were O
really O
absent, O

but O
had O
not O
courage O
for O
it. O

At O
length, O
however, O
the O
question O
was O
asked O
by O
her O
uncle; O

and O
she O
turned O
away O
with O
alarm, O
while O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
replied O
that O
he O
was, O

adding, O
"but O
we O
expect O
him O
tomorrow, O
with O
a O
large O
party O
of O
friends." O

How O
rejoiced O
was O
Elizabeth B-Person
that O
their O
own O
journey O
had O
not O
by O
any O
circumstance O

been O
delayed O
a O
day! O

Her O
aunt O
now O
called O
her O
to O
look O
at O
a O
picture. O

She O
approached, O
and O
saw O
the O
likeness O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
suspended, O

amongst O
several O
other O
miniatures B-Misc
, O
over O
the O
mantlepiece B-Misc
. O

Her O
aunt O
asked O
her, O
smilingly, O
how O
she O
liked O
it. O

The O
housekeeper O
came O
forward, O
and O
told O
them O
it O
was O
the O
picture O
of O
a O
young O
gentleman, O

the O
son O
of O
her O
late O
master's O
steward, O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
by O
him O
at O
his O
own O
expence. O

"He O
is O
now O
gone O
into O
the O
army," O
she O
added, O
"but O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
has O
turned O
out O
very O
wild." O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
looked O
at O
her O
niece O
with O
a O
smile, O
but O
Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
return O
it. O

"And O
that," O
said O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
, O
pointing O
to O
another O
of O
the O
miniatures B-Misc
, O

"is O
my O
master O
-- O
and O
very O
like O
him. O
It O
was O
drawn O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
other O
-- O

about O
eight O
years O
ago." O

"I O
have O
heard O
much O
of O
your O
master's O
fine O
person," O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

looking O
at O
the O
picture; O
"it O
is O
a O
handsome O
face. O
But, O
Lizzy B-Person
, O

you O
can O
tell O
us O
whether O
it O
is O
like O
or O
not." O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
's O
respect O
for O
Elizabeth B-Person
seemed O
to O
increase O
on O
this O
intimation O
of O
her O

knowing O
her O
master. O

"Does O
that O
young O
lady O
know O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
?" O

Elizabeth B-Person
coloured, O
and O
said O
-- O
"A O
little." O

"And O
do O
not O
you O
think O
him O
a O
very O
handsome O
gentleman, O
Ma'am?" O

"Yes, O
very O
handsome." O

"I O
am O
sure O
I O
know O
none O
so O
handsome; O
but O
in O
the O
gallery O
up O
stairs O
you O
will O
see O
a O
finer, O

larger O
picture O
of O
him O
than O
this. O

This O
room O
was O
my O
late O
master's O
favourite O
room, O
and O
these O
miniatures B-Misc
are O
just O
as O
they O
used O
to O
be O
then. O
He O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
them." O

This O
accounted O
to O
Elizabeth B-Person
for O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
's O
being O
among O
them. O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
then O
directed O
their O
attention O
to O
one O
of O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
, O

drawn O
when O
she O
was O
only O
eight O
years O
old. O

"And O
is O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
as O
handsome O
as O
her O
brother?" O
said O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

"Oh! O
yes O
-- O
the O
handsomest O
young O
lady O
that O
ever O
was O
seen; O

and O
so O
accomplished! O
-- O
She O
plays O
and O
sings O
all O
day O
long. O

In O
the O
next O
room O
is O
a O
new O
instrument O
just O
come O
down O
for O
her O
-- O
a O
present O
from O
my O
master; O

she O
comes O
here O
to-morrow O
with O
him." O

Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
whose O
manners O
were O
easy O
and O
pleasant, O

encouraged O
her O
communicativeness O
by O
his O
questions O
and O
remarks; O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
, O
either O
from O
pride O
or O
attachment, O

had O
evidently O
great O
pleasure O
in O
talking O
of O
her O
master O
and O
his O
sister. O

"Is O
your O
master O
much O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
year?" O

"Not O
so O
much O
as O
I O
could O
wish, O
Sir; O
but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
may O
spend O
half O
his O
time O
here; O

and O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
is O
always O
down O
for O
the O
summer O
months." O

"Except," O
thought O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
"when O
she O
goes O
to O
Ramsgate B-Location
." O

"If O
your O
master O
would O
marry, O
you O
might O
see O
more O
of O
him." O

"Yes, O
Sir; O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
when O
that O
will O
be. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
him." O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
smiled. O
Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
help O
saying, O

"It O
is O
very O
much O
to O
his O
credit, O
I O
am O
sure, O
that O
you O
should O
think O
so." O

"I O
say O
no O
more O
than O
the O
truth, O
and O
what O
every O
body O
will O
say O
that O
knows O
him," O

replied O
the O
other. O
Elizabeth B-Person
thought O
this O
was O
going O
pretty O
far; O

and O
she O
listened O
with O
increasing O
astonishment O
as O
the O
housekeeper O
added, O

"I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
cross O
word O
from O
him O
in O
my O
life, O

and O
I O
have O
known O
him O
ever O
since O
he O
was O
four O
years O
old." O

This O
was O
praise, O
of O
all O
others O
most O
extraordinary, O
most O
opposite O
to O
her O
ideas. O

That O
he O
was O
not O
a O
good O
tempered O
man O
had O
been O
her O
firmest O
opinion. O

Her O
keenest O
attention O
was O
awakened; O

she O
longed O
to O
hear O
more, O
and O
was O
grateful O
to O
her O
uncle O
for O
saying, O

"There O
are O
very O
few O
people O
of O
whom O
so O
much O
can O
be O
said. O

You O
are O
lucky O
in O
having O
such O
a O
master." O

"Yes, O
Sir, O
I O
know O
I O
am. O
If O
I O
was O
to O
go O
through O
the O
world, O

I O
could O
not O
meet O
with O
a O
better. O

But O
I O
have O
always O
observed O
that O
they O
who O
are O
good-natured O
when O
children O
are O
good-natured O

when O
they O
grow O
up; O
and O
he O
was O
always O
the O
sweetest-tempered, O

most O
generous-hearted, O
boy O
in O
the O
world." O

Elizabeth B-Person
almost O
stared O
at O
her. O
-- O
"Can O
this O
be O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
!" O
thought O
she. O

"His O
father O
was O
an O
excellent O
man," O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

"Yes, O
Ma'am, O
that O
he O
was O
indeed; O
and O
his O
son O
will O
be O
just O
like O
him O
-- O
just O
as O
affable O
to O
the O
poor." O

Elizabeth B-Person
listened, O
wondered, O
doubted, O
and O
was O
impatient O
for O
more. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person

could O
interest O
her O
on O
no O
other O
point. O

She O
related O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
pictures, O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
rooms, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
the O
furniture, O
in O
vain. O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
highly O
amused O
by O
the O
kind O
of O
family O
prejudice O
to O
which O

he O
attributed O
her O
excessive O
commendation O
of O
her O
master, O

soon O
led O
again O
to O
the O
subject; O
and O
she O
dwelt O
with O
energy O
on O
his O
many O
merits, O

as O
they O
proceeded O
together O
up O
the O
great O
staircase B-Misc
. O

"He O
is O
the O
best O
landlord, O
and O
the O
best O
master," O
said O
she, O
"that O
ever O
lived. O

Not O
like O
the O
wild O
young O
men O
now-a-days, O
who O
think O
of O
nothing O
but O
themselves. O

There O
is O
not O
one O
of O
his O
tenants O
or O
servants O
but O
what O
will O
give O
him O
a O
good O
name. O

Some O
people O
call O
him O
proud; O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
thing O
of O
it. O

To O
my O
fancy, O
it O
is O
only O
because O
he O
does O
not O
rattle O
away O
like O
other O
young O
men." O

"In O
what O
an O
amiable O
light O
does O
this O
place O
him!" O
thought O
Elizabeth B-Person
. O

"This O
fine O
account O
of O
him," O
whispered O
her O
aunt, O
as O
they O
walked, O

"is O
not O
quite O
consistent O
with O
his O
behaviour O
to O
our O
poor O
friend." O

"Perhaps O
we O
might O
be O
deceived." O

"That O
is O
not O
very O
likely; O
our O
authority O
was O
too O
good." O

On O
reaching O
the O
spacious O
lobby B-Misc
above, O
they O
were O
shewn O
into O
a O
very O
pretty O
sitting B-Misc
room I-Misc
, O
lately O
fitted O
up O
with O
greater O
elegance O
and O
lightness O
than O
the O
apartments B-Misc
below; O

and O
were O
informed O
that O
it O
was O
but O
just O
done O
to O
give O
pleasure O
to O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
, O

who O
had O
taken O
a O
liking O
to O
the O
room O
when O
last O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
. O

"He O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
brother," O
said O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

as O
she O
walked O
towards O
one O
of O
the O
window B-Misc
. O

Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
anticipated O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
's O
delight O
when O
she O
should O
enter O
the O
room. O
"And O
this O
is O
always O
the O
way O
with O
him," O
she O
added. O
-- O
"Whatever O
can O
give O
his O
sister O
any O
pleasure O
is O
sure O
to O
be O
done O
in O
a O
moment. O
There O
is O
nothing O
he O
would O
not O
do O
for O
her." O

The O
picture B-Misc
gallery I-Misc
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
of O
the O
principal O
bedrooms, O
were O
all O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
shewn. O
In O
the O
former O
were O
many O
good O
paintings; O
but O
Elizabeth B-Person
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
art; O
and O
from O
such O
as O
had O
been O
already O
visible O
below, O
she O
had O
willingly O
turned O
to O
look O
at O
some O

drawings O
of O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
's, O
in O
crayons, O
whose O
subjects O
were O
usually O
more O
interesting, O

and O
also O
more O
intelligible. O

In O
the O
gallery O
there O
were O
many O
family O
portraits B-Misc
, O
but O
they O
could O
have O
little O
to O
fix O
the O
attention O
of O

a O
stranger. O
Elizabeth B-Person
walked O
on O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
only O
face O
whose O
features O
would O
be O
known O

to O
her. O
At O
last O
it O
arrested O
her O
-- O
and O
she O
beheld O
a O
striking O
resemblance O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O

with O
such O
a O
smile O
over O
the O
face O
as O
she O
remembered O
to O
have O
sometimes O
seen, O

when O
he O
looked O
at O
her. O
She O
stood O
several O
minutes O
before O
the O
picture O
in O
earnest O
contemplation, O

and O
returned O
to O
it O
again O
before O
they O
quitted O
the O
gallery. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
informed O
them O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
his O
father's O
life O
time. O

There O
was O
certainly O
at O
this O
moment, O
in O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
mind, O

a O
more O
gentle O
sensation O
towards O
the O
original O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
felt O
in O
the O
height O
of O
their O

acquaintance. O
The O
commendation O
bestowed O
on O
him O
by O
Mrs. O
Reynolds B-Person
was O
of O
no O
trifling O

nature. O

What O
praise O
is O
more O
valuable O
than O
the O
praise O
of O
an O
intelligent O
servant? O

As O
a O
brother, O
a O
landlord, O
a O
master, O
she O
considered O
how O
many O
people's O
happiness O
were O
in O
his O

guardianship! O
-- O
How O
much O
of O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
it O
was O
in O
his O
power O
to O
bestow! O

-- O
How O
much O
of O
good O
or O
evil O
must O
be O
done O
by O
him! O

Every O
idea O
that O
had O
been O
brought O
forward O
by O
the O
housekeeper O
was O
favourable O
to O
his O
character, O

and O
as O
she O
stood O
before O
the O
canvas B-Misc
, O
on O
which O
he O
was O
represented, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O

herself, O
she O
thought O
of O
his O
regard O
with O
a O
deeper O
sentiment O
of O
gratitude O
than O
it O
had O
ever O
raised O

before; O
she O
remembered O
its O
warmth, O
and O
softened O
its O
impropriety O
of O
expression. O

When O
all O
of O
the O
house O
that O
was O
open O
to O
general O
inspection O
had O
been O
seen, O

they O
returned O
down O
stairs, O
and, O
taking O
leave O
of O
the O
housekeeper, O

were O
consigned O
over O
to O
the O
gardener, O
who O
met O
them O
at O
the O
hall B-Misc
door#Misc*]. O

As O
they O
walked O
across O
the O
lawn B-Misc
towards O
the O
river B-Misc
, O
Elizabeth B-Person
turned O
back O
to O

look O
again; O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
stopped O
also, O
and O
while O
the O
former O
was O
conjecturing O
as O
to O
the O

date O
of O
the O
building B-Misc
, O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
himself O
suddenly O
came O
forward O
from O
the O
road B-Misc
, O

which O
led O
behind O
it O
to O
the O
stables. O

They O
were O
within O
twenty O
yards O
of O
each O
other, O
and O
so O
abrupt O
was O
his O
appearance, O

that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
his O
sight. O
Their O
eyes O
instantly O
met, O
and O
the O
cheeks O
of O
each O
were O

overspread O
with O
the O
deepest O
blush. O

He O
absolutely O
started, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
seemed O
immoveable O
from O
surprise; O

but O
shortly O
recovering O
himself, O
advanced O
towards O
the O
party, O
and O
spoke O
to O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

if O
not O
in O
terms O
of O
perfect O
composure, O
at O
least O
of O
perfect O
civility. O

She O
had O
instinctively O
turned O
away; O
but, O
stopping O
on O
his O
approach, O

received O
his O
compliments O
with O
an O
embarrassment O
impossible O
to O
be O
overcome. O

Had O
his O
first O
appearance, O
or O
his O
resemblance O
to O
the O
picture O
they O
had O
just O
been O
examining, O

been O
insufficient O
to O
assure O
the O
other O
two O
that O
they O
now O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O

the O
gardener's O
expression O
of O
surprise O
on O
beholding O
his O
master O
must O
immediately O
have O
told O
it. O

They O
stood O
a O
little O
aloof O
while O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
their O
niece, O
who, O
astonished O
and O
confused, O

scarcely O
dared O
lift O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
face, O
and O
knew O
not O
what O
answer O
she O
returned O
to O
his O

civil O
enquiries O
after O
her O
family. O

Amazed O
at O
the O
alteration O
in O
his O
manner O
since O
they O
last O
parted, O
every O
sentence O
that O
he O
uttered O
was O
increasing O
her O
embarrassment; O
and O
every O
idea O
of O
the O
impropriety O
of O
her O
being O
found O
there O

recurring O
to O
her O
mind, O
the O
few O
minutes O
in O
which O
they O
continued O
together O
were O
some O
of O
the O
most O

uncomfortable O
of O
her O
life. O

Nor O
did O
he O
seem O
much O
more O
at O
ease; O
when O
he O
spoke, O

his O
accent O
had O
none O
of O
its O
usual O
sedateness; O

and O
he O
repeated O
his O
enquiries O
as O
to O
the O
time O
of O
her O
having O
left O
Long B-Location
bourn I-Location
, O

and O
of O
her O
stay O
in O
Derbyshire B-Location
, O
so O
often, O
and O
in O
so O
hurried O
a O
way, O
as O
plainly O
spoke O
the O

distraction O
of O
his O
thoughts. O

At O
length, O
every O
idea O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him; O
and, O
after O
standing O
a O
few O
moments O
without O
saying O
a O

word, O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
himself, O
and O
took O
leave. O

The O
others O
then O
joined O
her, O
and O
expressed O
their O
admiration O
of O
his O
figure; O

but O
Elizabeth B-Person
heard O
not O
a O
word, O
and, O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
own O
feelings, O

followed O
them O
in O
silence. O

She O
was O
overpowered O
by O
shame O
and O
vexation. O

Her O
coming O
there O
was O
the O
most O
unfortunate, O
the O
most O
ill-judged O
thing O
in O
the O
world! O

How O
strange O
must O
it O
appear O
to O
him! O

In O
what O
a O
disgraceful O
light O
might O
it O
not O
strike O
so O
vain O
a O
man! O

It O
might O
seem O
as O
if O
she O
had O
purposely O
thrown O
herself O
in O
his O
way O
again! O

Oh! O
why O
did O
she O
come? O
or, O
why O
did O
he O
thus O
come O
a O
day O
before O
he O
was O
expected? O

Had O
they O
been O
only O
ten O
minutes O
sooner, O

they O
should O
have O
been O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
his O
discrimination, O

for O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
that O
moment O
arrived, O

that O
moment O
alighted O
from O
his O
horse B-Misc
or O
his O
carriage B-Misc
. O

She O
blushed O
again O
and O
again O
over O
the O
perverseness O
of O
the O
meeting. O

And O
his O
behaviour, O
so O
strikingly O
altered, O
-- O
what O
could O
it O
mean? O

That O
he O
should O
even O
speak O
to O
her O
was O
amazing! O

but O
to O
speak O
with O
such O
civility, O
to O
enquire O
after O
her O
family! O

Never O
in O
her O
life O
had O
she O
seen O
his O
manners O
so O
little O
dignified, O

never O
had O
he O
spoken O
with O
such O
gentleness O
as O
on O
this O
unexpected O
meeting. O

What O
a O
contrast O
did O
it O
offer O
to O
his O
last O
address O
in O
Rosings B-Location
Park I-Location
, O

when O
he O
put O
his O
letter O
into O
her O
hand! O

She O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
think, O
nor O
how O
to O
account O
for O
it. O

They O
had O
now O
entered O
a O
beautiful O
walk O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O

and O
every O
step O
was O
bringing O
forward O
a O
nobler O
fall O
of O
ground B-Misc
, O

or O
a O
finer O
reach O
of O
the O
wood B-Misc
s O
to O
which O
they O
were O
approaching; O

but O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
Elizabeth B-Person
was O
sensible O
of O
any O
of O
it; O

and, O
though O
she O
answered O
mechanically O
to O
the O
repeated O
appeals O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt, O

and O
seemed O
to O
direct O
her O
eyes O
to O
such O
objects O
as O
they O
pointed O
out, O

she O
distinguished O
no O
part O
of O
the O
scene. O

Her O
thoughts O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
that O
one O
spot O
of O
Pemberley B-Location
House I-Location
, O

whichever O
it O
might O
be, O
where O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
then O
was. O

She O
longed O
to O
know O
what O
at O
that O
moment O
was O
passing O
in O
his O
mind; O

in O
what O
manner O
he O
thought O
of O
her, O
and O
whether, O
in O
defiance O
of O
every O
thing, O

she O
was O
still O
dear O
to O
him. O

Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
civil O
only O
because O
he O
felt O
himself O
at O
ease; O

yet O
there O
had O
been O
that O
in O
his O
voice O
which O
was O
not O
like O
ease. O

Whether O
he O
had O
felt O
more O
of O
pain O
or O
of O
pleasure O
in O
seeing O
her, O
she O
could O
not O
tell, O

but O
he O
certainly O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
with O
composure. O

At O
length, O
however, O
the O
remarks O
of O
her O
companions O
on O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
roused O
her, O

and O
she O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
appearing O
more O
like O
herself. O

They O
entered O
the O
wood B-Misc
s, O
and O
bidding O
adieu O
to O
the O
river B-Misc
for O
a O
while, O

ascended O
some O
of O
the O
higher O
ground B-Misc
s; O

whence, O
in O
spots O
where O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
trees B-Misc
gave O
the O
eye O
power O
to O
wander, O

were O
many O
charming O
views O
of O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
the O
opposite O
hills B-Misc
, O

with O
the O
long O
range O
of O
wood B-Misc
s O
overspreading O
many, O
and O
occasionally O
part O
of O
the O
stream B-Misc
. O

Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
expressed O
a O
wish O
of O
going O
round O
the O
whole B-Location
Park I-Location
, O

but O
feared O
it O
might O
be O
beyond O
a O
walk. O

With O
a O
triumphant O
smile, O
they O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
ten O
miles O
round. O

It O
settled O
the O
matter; O
and O
they O
pursued O
the O
accustomed O
circuit; O

which O
brought O
them O
again, O
after O
some O
time, O
in O
a O
descent O
among O
hanging O
wood B-Misc
s, O

to O
the O
edge O
of O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O
in O
one O
of O
its O
narrowest O
parts. O

They O
crossed O
it O
by O
a O
simple O
bridge B-Misc
, O
in O
character O
with O
the O
general O
air O
of O
the O
scene; O

it O
was O
a O
spot O
less O
adorned O
than O
any O
they O
had O
yet O
visited; O

and O
the O
valley B-Misc
, O
here O
contracted O
into O
a O
glen, O
allowed O
room O
only O
for O
the O
stream B-Misc
, O

and O
a O
narrow O
walk O
amidst O
the O
rough O
coppice B-Misc
- O
wood B-Misc
which O
bordered O
it. O

Elizabeth B-Person
longed O
to O
explore O
its O
windings; O

but O
when O
they O
had O
crossed O
the O
bridge B-Misc
, O
and O
perceived O
their O
distance O
from O
the O
house, O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who O
was O
not O
a O
great O
walker, O
could O
go O
no O
farther, O

and O
thought O
only O
of O
returning O
to O
the O
carriage B-Misc
as O
quickly O
as O
possible. O

Her O
niece O
was, O
therefore, O
obliged O
to O
submit, O

and O
they O
took O
their O
way O
towards O
the O
house B-Misc
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
river B-Misc
, O

in O
the O
nearest O
direction; O
but O
their O
progress O
was O
slow, O
for O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

though O
seldom O
able O
to O
indulge O
the O
taste, O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
fishing, O

and O
was O
so O
much O
engaged O
in O
watching O
the O
occasional O
appearance O
of O
some O
trout O
in O
the B-Misc
water I-Misc
, O
and O
talking O
to O
the O
man O
about O
them, O
that O
he O
advanced O
but O
little. O

Whilst O
wandering O
on O
in O
this O
slow O
manner, O
they O
were O
again O
surprised, O

and O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
astonishment O
was O
quite O
equal O
to O
what O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first, O

by O
the O
sight O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
approaching O
them, O
and O
at O
no O
great O
distance. O

The O
walk O
being O
here O
less O
sheltered O
than O
on O
the O
other O
side, O

allowed O
them O
to O
see O
him O
before O
they O
met. O

Elizabeth B-Person
, O
however O
astonished, O
was O
at O
least O
more O
prepared O
for O
an O
interview O
than O
before, O

and O
resolved O
to O
appear O
and O
to O
speak O
with O
calmness, O
if O
he O
really O
intended O
to O
meet O
them. O

For O
a O
few O
moments, O
indeed, O
she O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
strike O
into O
some O
other O
path. O

This O
idea O
lasted O
while O
a O
turning O
in O
the O
walk O
concealed O
him O
from O
their O
view; O
the O
turning O
past, O
he O
was O
immediately O
before O
them. O
With O
a O
glance O
she O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
none O
of O
his O
recent O
civility; O
and, O
to O
imitate O
his O
politeness, O
she O
began, O
as O
they O
met, O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
place; O

but O
she O
had O
not O
got O
beyond O
the O
words O
"delightful," O
and O
"charming," O

when O
some O
unlucky O
recollections O
obtruded, O
and O
she O
fancied O
that O
praise O
of O
Pemberley B-Location

from O
her O
might O
be O
mischievously O
construed. O
Her O
colour O
changed, O
and O
she O
said O
no O
more. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
was O
standing O
a O
little O
behind; O
and O
on O
her O
pausing, O

he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
do O
him O
the O
honour O
of O
introducing O
him O
to O
her O
friends. O

This O
was O
a O
stroke O
of O
civility O
for O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
unprepared; O

and O
she O
could O
hardly O
suppress O
a O
smile O
at O
his O
being O
now O
seeking O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
some O
of O

those O
very O
people O
against O
whom O
his O
pride O
had O
revolted, O
in O
his O
offer O
to O
herself. O
" O

What O
will O
be O
his O
surprise," O
thought O
she, O
"when O
he O
knows O
who O
they O
are! O

He O
takes O
them O
now O
for O
people O
of O
fashion." O

The O
introduction, O
however, O
was O
immediately O
made; O

and O
as O
she O
named O
their O
relationship O
to O
herself, O
she O
stole O
a O
sly O
look O
at O
him, O

to O
see O
how O
he O
bore O
it; O
and O
was O
not O
without O
the O
expectation O
of O
his O
decamping O

as O
fast O
as O
he O
could O
from O
such O
disgraceful O
companions. O

That O
he O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
connexion O
was O
evident; O

he O
sustained O
it O
however O
with O
fortitude, O
and O
so O
far O
from O
going O
away, O
turned O
back O
with O
them, O

and O
entered O
into O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
. O

Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
but O
be O
pleased, O
could O
not O
but O
triumph. O

It O
was O
consoling O
that O
he O
should O
know O
she O
had O
some O
relations O
for O
whom O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O

blush. O

She O
listened O
most O
attentively O
to O
all O
that O
passed O
between O
them, O
and O
gloried O
in O
every O
expression, O

every O
sentence O
of O
her O
uncle, O
which O
marked O
his O
intelligence, O
his O
taste, O
or O
his O
good O
manners. O

The O
conversation O
soon O
turned O
upon O
fishing, O
and O
she O
heard O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
invite O
him, O

with O
the O
greatest O
civility, O
to O
fish O
there O
as O
often O
as O
he O
chose O

while O
he O
continued O
in O
the O
neighbourhood B-Location
, O
offering O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
supply O
him O

with O
fishing O
tackle, O
and O
pointing O
out O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
stream B-Misc
where O
there O
was O
usually O

most O
sport. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who O
was O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
with O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

gave O
her O
a O
look O
expressive O
of O
her O
wonder. O

Elizabeth B-Person
said O
nothing, O
but O
it O
gratified O
her O
exceedingly; O

the O
compliment O
must O
be O
all O
for O
herself. O

Her O
astonishment, O
however, O
was O
extreme; O

and O
continually O
was O
she O
repeating, O
"Why O
is O
he O
so O
altered? O
From O
what O
can O
it O
proceed? O

It O
cannot O
be O
for O
me, O
it O
cannot O
be O
for O
my O
sake O
that O
his O
manners O
are O
thus O
softened. O

My O
reproofs O
at O
Hunsford B-Location
could O
not O
work O
such O
a O
change O
as O
this. O

It O
is O
impossible O
that O
he O
should O
still O
love O
me." O

After O
walking O
some O
time O
in O
this O
way, O
the O
two O
ladies O
in O
front, O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
behind, O

on O
resuming O
their O
places O
after O
descending O
to O
the O
brink O
of O
the O
river B-Misc
for O
the O
better O
inspection O
of O
some O
curious O
water B-Misc
plant I-Misc
, O
there O
chanced O
to O
be O
a O
little O
alteration. O

It O
originated O
in O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O
who, O
fatigued O
by O
the O
exercise O
of O
the O
morning, O

found O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
arm O
inadequate O
to O
her O
support, O

and O
consequently O
preferred O
her O
husband's. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
took O
her O
place O
by O
her O
niece, O
and O
they O
walked O
on O
together. O

After O
a O
short O
silence, O
the O
lady O
first O
spoke. O

She O
wished O
him O
to O
know O
that O
she O
had O
been O
assured O
of O
his O
absence O
before O
she O
came O
to O
the O
place, O

and O
accordingly O
began O
by O
observing O
that O
his O
arrival O
had O
been O
very O
unexpected. O

she O
added, O
"informed O
us O
that O
you O
would O
certainly O
not O
be O
here O
till O
to-morrow; O

and O
indeed, O
before O
we O
left O
Bakewell B-Location
we O
understood O
that O
you O
were O
not O
immediately O

expected O
in O
the O
country B-Location
." O
He O
acknowledged O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
all; O

and O
said O
that O
business O
with O
his O
steward O
had O
occasioned O
his O
coming O
forward O
a O
few O
hours O
before O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
party O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
travelling. O

"They O
will O
join O
me O
early O
tomorrow," O
he O
continued, O
"and O
among O
them O
are O
some O
who O
will O

claim O
an O
acquaintance O
with O
you, O
-- O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
and O
his O
sisters." O

Elizabeth B-Person
answered O
only O
by O
a O
slight O
bow. O

Her O
thoughts O
were O
instantly O
driven O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
's O
name O
had O
been O

last O
mentioned O
between O
them; O

and O
if O
she O
might O
judge O
from O
his O
complexion, O
his O
mind O
was O
not O
very O
differently O
engaged. O

"There O
is O
also O
one O
other O
person O
in O
the O
party," O
he O
continued O
after O
a O
pause, O

"who O
more O
particularly O
wishes O
to O
be O
known O
to O
you, O

Will O
you O
allow O
me, O
or O
do O
I O
ask O
too O
much, O
to O
introduce O
my O
sister O
to O
your O
acquaintance O

during O
your O
stay O
at O
Lambton B-Location
?" O

The O
surprise O
of O
such O
an O
application O
was O
great O
indeed; O

it O
was O
too O
great O
for O
her O
to O
know O
in O
what O
manner O
she O
acceded O
to O
it. O

She O
immediately O
felt O
that O
whatever O
desire O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
might O
have O
of O
being O
acquainted O

with O
her O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
her O
brother, O
and O
without O
looking O
farther, O

it O
was O
satisfactory; O
it O
was O
gratifying O
to O
know O
that O
his O
resentment O
had O
not O
made O
him O
think O
really O

ill O
of O
her. O

They O
now O
walked O
on O
in O
silence; O
each O
of O
them O
deep O
in O
thought. O

Elizabeth B-Person
was O
not O
comfortable; O

that O
was O
impossible; O

but O
she O
was O
lattered O
and O
pleased. O

His O
wish O
of O
introducing O
his O
sister O
to O
her O
was O
a O
compliment O
of O
the O
highest O
kind. O

They O
soon O
outstripped O
the O
others, O
and O
when O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
carriage B-Misc
, O

Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
were O
half O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
behind. O

He O
then O
asked O
her O
to O
walk O
into O
the O
house B-Misc
-- O
but O
she O
declared O
herself O
not O
tired, O

and O
they O
stood O
together O
on O
the O
lawn B-Misc
. O
At O
such O
a O
time, O
much O
might O
have O
been O
said, O

and O
silence O
was O
very O
awkward. O

She O
wanted O
to O
talk, O
but O
there O
seemed O
an O
embargo O
on O
every O
subject. O

At O
last O
she O
recollected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
travelling, O

and O
they O
talked O
of O
Matlock B-Location
and O
Dove B-Location
Dale I-Location
with O
great O
perseverance. O

Yet O
time O
and O
her O
aunt O
moved O
slowly O
-- O
and O
her O
patience O
and O
her O
ideas O
were O
nearly O
worn O
out. O

On O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
's O
coming O
up, O

they O
were O
all O
pressed O
to O
go O
into O
the O
house B-Location
and O
take O
some O
refreshment; O

but O
this O
was O
declined, O
and O
they O
parted O
on O
each O
side O
with O
the O
utmost O
politeness. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
handed O
the O
ladies O
into O
the O
carriage B-Misc
, O
and O
when O
it O
drove O
off, O

Elizabeth B-Person
saw O
him O
walking O
slowly O
towards O
the O
house B-Location
. O

"To O
be O
sure, O
Lizzy B-Person
," O
said O
her O
aunt, O
"he O
is O
not O
so O
handsome O
as O
Wickham B-Person
; O
or O
rather O
he O
has O
not O
Wickham B-Person
's O
countenance, O
for O
his O
features O
are O
perfectly O
good. O
But O
how O
came O
you O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
he O
was O
so O
disagreeable?" O

Elizabeth B-Person
excused O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could; O

said O
that O
she O
had O
liked O
him O
better O
when O
they O
met O
in O
Kent B-Location
than O
before, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
him O
so O
pleasant O
as O
this O
morning. O

"But O
perhaps O
he O
may O
be O
a O
little O
whimsical O
in O
his O
civilities," O
replied O
her O
uncle. O

"Your O
great O
men O
often O
are; O
and O
therefore O
I O
shall O
not O
take O
him O
at O
his O
word O
about O
fishing, O

as O
he O
might O
change O
his O
mind O
another O
day, O
and O
warn O
me O
off O
his O
grounds." O

Elizabeth B-Person
felt O
that O
they O
had O
entirely O
mistaken O
his O
character, O
but O
said O
nothing. O

"From O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
of O
him," O
continued O
Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
, O

"I O
really O
should O
not O
have O
thought O
that O
he O
could O
have O
behaved O
in O
so O
cruel O
a O
way O
by O
any O
body, O

as O
he O
has O
done O
by O
poor O
Wickham B-Person
. O

He O
has O
not O
an O
ill-natured O
look. O

On O
the O
contrary, O
there O
is O
something O
pleasing O
about O
his O
mouth O
when O
he O
speaks. O

And O
there O
is O
something O
of O
dignity O
in O
his O
countenance, O

that O
would O
not O
give O
one O
an O
unfavourable O
idea O
of O
his O
heart. O

But O
to O
be O
sure, O
the O
good O
lady O
who O
shewed O
us O
the O
house B-Location
did O
give O
him O
a O
most O

flaming O
character! O

I O
could O
hardly O
help O
laughing O
aloud O
sometimes. O
But O
he O
is O
a O
liberal O
master, O
I O
suppose, O
and O
that O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
servant O
comprehends O
every O
virtue." O

Elizabeth B-Person
here O
felt O
herself O
called O
on O
to O
say O
something O
in O
vindication O
of O
his O
behaviour O
to O
Wickham B-Person
; O
and O
therefore O
gave O
them O
to O
understand, O
in O
as O
guarded O
a O
manner O
as O
she O
could, O

that O
by O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
from O
his O
relations O
in O
Kent B-Location
, O
his O
actions O
were O
capable O
of O
a O

very O
different O
construction; O
and O
that O
his O
character O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O
faulty, O

nor O
Wickham B-Person
's O
so O
amiable, O
as O
they O
had O
been O
considered O
in O
Hertfordshire B-Location
. O
In O
confirmation O
of O
this, O
she O
related O
the O
particulars O
of O
all O
the O
pecuniary O
transactions O
in O
which O
they O
had O
been O
connected, O
without O
actually O
naming O
her O
authority, O
but O
stating O
it O
to O
be O
such O
as O
might O
be O
relied O
on. O

Mrs. O
Gardiner B-Person
was O
surprised O
and O
concerned; O
but O
as O
they O
were O
now O
approaching O
the O
scene O
of O
her O
former O
pleasures, O
every O
idea O
gave O
way O
to O
the O
charm O
of O
recollection; O
and O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engaged O
in O
pointing O
out O
to O
her O
husband O
all O
the O
interesting O
spots O
in O
its O
environs O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else. O
Fatigued O
as O
she O
had O
been O
by O
the O
morning's O
walk, O
they O
had O
no O
sooner O
dined O
than O
she O
set O
off O
again O
in O
quest O
of O
her O
former O
acquaintance, O
and O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
the O
satisfactions O
of O
an O
intercourse O
renewed O
after O
many O
years O
discontinuance. O

The O
occurrences O
of O
the O
day O
were O
too O
full O
of O
interest O
to O
leave O
Elizabeth B-Person
much O
attention O
for O
any O
of O
these O
new O
friends; O
and O
she O
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
think, O
and O
think O
with O
wonder, O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
's O
civility, O
and O
above O
all, O
of O
his O
wishing O
her O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
his O
sister. O

Elizabeth B-Person
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
receiving O
an O
answer O
to O
her O
letter O
as O
soon O
as O

she O
possibly O
could. O

She O
was O
no O
sooner O
in O
possession O
of O
it O
than, O
hurrying O
into O
the O
little O
copse B-Location
, O

where O
she O
was O
least O
likely O
to O
be O
interrupted, O

she O
sat O
down O
on O
one O
of O
the O
benches B-Misc
and O
prepared O
to O
be O
happy; O

for O
the O
length O
of O

Sept. O

MY O
DEAR O
NIECE, O

I O
have O
just O
received O
your O
letter, O

and O
shall O
devote O
this O
whole O
morning O
to O
answering O
it, O

as O
I O
foresee O
that O
a O
little O
writing O
will O
not O
comprise O
what O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you. O

I O
must O
confess O
myself O
surprised O
by O
your O
application; O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
it O
from O
you. O

Don't O
think O
me O
angry, O
however, O

for O
I O
only O
mean O
to O
let O
you O
know O
that O
I O
had O
not O
imagined O
such O
enquiries O
to O
be O
necessary O

on O
your O
side. O

If O
you O
do O
not O
choose O
to O
understand O
me, O
forgive O
my O
impertinence. O

Your O
uncle O
is O
as O
much O
surprised O
as O
I O
am O
-- O

and O
nothing O
but O
the O
belief O
of O
your O
being O
a O
party O
concerned O
would O
have O

allowed O
him O
to O
act O
as O
he O
has O
done. O

But O
if O
you O
are O
really O
innocent O
and O
ignorant, O
I O
must O
be O
more O
explicit. O

On O
the O
very O
day O
of O
my O
coming O
home O
from O
Longbourn B-Location
, O

your O
uncle O
had O
a O
most O
unexpected O
visitor. O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
called, O

and O
was O
shut O
up O
with O
him O
several O
hours. O

It O
was O
all O
over O
before O
I O
arrived; O

so O
my O
curiosity O
was O
not O
so O
dreadfully O
racked O
as O
your'seems O
to O
have O
been. O

He O
came O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
that O
he O
had O
found O
out O
where O
your O
sister O
and O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
were, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
and O
talked O
with O
them O
both; O
Wickham B-Person
repeatedly, O

Lydia B-Person
once. O
From O
what O
I O
can O
collect, O
he O
left O
Derbyshire B-Location
only O

one O
day O
after O
ourselves, O
and O
came O
to O
town O
with O
the O
resolution O
of O
hunting O
for O
them. O

The O
motive O
professed O
was O
his O
conviction O
of O
its O
being O
owing O
to O
himself O
that O
Wickham B-Person
's O

worthlessness O
had O
not O
been O
so O
well O
known O
as O
to O
make O
it O
impossible O
for O
any O
young O
woman O

of O
character O
to O
love O
or O
confide O
in O
him. O

He O
generously O
imputed O
the O
whole O
to O
his O
mistaken O
pride, O

and O
confessed O
that O
he O
had O
before O
thought O
it O
beneath O
him O
to O

lay O
his O
private O
actions O
open O
to O
the O
world. O

His O
character O
was O
to O
speak O
for O
itself. O

He O
called O
it, O
therefore, O
his O
duty O
to O
step O
forward, O

and O
endeavour O
to O
remedy O
an O
evil O
which O
had O
been O
brought O
on O
by O
himself. O

If O
he O
had O
another O
motive, O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
would O
never O
disgrace O
him. O

He O
had O
been O
some O
days O
in O
town, O
before O
he O
was O
able O
to O
discover O
them; O

but O
he O
had O
something O
to O
direct O
his O
search, O

which O
was O
more O
than O
we O
had; O

and O
the O
consciousness O
of O
this O
was O
another O
reason O
for O
his O
resolving O
to O
follow O
us. O
There O
is O
a O
lady, O
it O
seems, O
a O
Mrs. O
Younge B-Person
, O

who O
was O
some O
time O
ago O
governess O
to O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
, O

and O
was O
dismissed O
from O
her O
charge O
on O
some O
cause O
of O
disapprobation, O

though O
he O
did O
not O
say O
what. O

She O
then O
took O
a O
large O
house O
in O
Edward B-Location
street I-Location
, O

and O
has O
since O
maintained O
herself O
by O
letting O
lodgings. O

This O
Mrs. O
Younge B-Person
was, O
he O
knew, O

intimately O
acquainted O
with O
Wickham B-Person
; O

and O
he O
went O
to O
her O
for O
intelligence O
of O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
got O
to O
town. O

But O
it O
was O
two O
or O
three O
days O
before O
he O
could O
get O
from O
her O
what O
he O
wanted. O

She O
would O
not O
betray O
her O
trust, O
I O
suppose, O

without O
bribery O
and O
corruption, O

for O
she O
really O
did O
know O
where O
her O
friend O
was O
to O
be O
found. O

Wickham B-Person
indeed O
had O
gone O
to O
her O
on O
their O
first O
arrival O
in O
London B-Location
, O
and O
had O
she O
been O
able O
to O
receive O
them O
into O
her O
house, O

they O
would O
have O
taken O
up O
their O
abode O
with O
her. O

At O
length, O
however, O
our O
kind O
friend O
procured O
the O
wished-for O
direction. O

They O
were O
in O
---- O
street. O
He O
saw O
Wickham B-Person
, O

and O
afterwards O
insisted O
on O
seeing O
Lydia B-Person
. O

His O
first O
object O
with O
her, O
he O
acknowledged, O

had O
been O
to O
persuade O
her O
to O
quit O
her O
present O
disgraceful O
situation, O

and O
return O
to O
her O
friends O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
could O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
receive O
her, O
offering O
his O
assistance, O
as O
far O
as O
it O
would O
go. O

But O
he O
found O
Lydia B-Person
absolutely O
resolved O
on O
remaining O
where O
she O
was. O

She O
cared O
for O
none O
of O
her O
friends; O

she O
wanted O
no O
help O
of O
his; O

she O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
leaving O
Wickham B-Person
. O

She O
was O
sure O
they O
should O
be O
married O
some O
time O
or O
other, O

and O
it O
did O
not O
much O
signify O
when. O
Since O
such O
were O
her O
feelings, O

it O
only O
remained, O
he O
thought, O
to O
secure O
and O
expedite O
a O
marriage, O

which, O
in O
his O
very O
first O
conversation O
with O
Wickham B-Person
, O

he O
easily O
learnt O
had O
never O
been O
his O
design. O
He O
confessed O
himself O
obliged O
to O

leave O
the O
regiment, O
on O
account O
of O
some O
debts O
of O
honour, O

which O
were O
very O
pressing; O

and O
scrupled O
not O
to O
lay O
all O
the O
ill-consequences O
of O
Lydia B-Person
's O
flight O
on O

her O
own O
folly O
alone. O

He O
meant O
to O
resign O
his O
commission O
immediately; O

and O
as O
to O
his O
future O
situation, O
he O
could O
conjecture O
very O
little O
about O
it. O

He O
must O
go O
somewhere, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
know O
where, O

and O
he O
knew O
he O
should O
have O
nothing O
to O
live O
on. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
asked O
him O
why O
he O
had O
not O
married O
your O
sister O
at O
once. O

Though O
Mr. O
Bennet B-Person
was O
not O
imagined O
to O
be O
very O
rich, O

he O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
something O
for O
him, O

and O
his O
situation O
must O
have O
been O
benefited O
by O
marriage. O

But O
he O
found, O
in O
reply O
to O
this O
question, O
that O
Wickham B-Person

still O
cherished O
the O
hope O
of O
more O
effectually O
making O
his O
fortune O
by O
marriage O
in O
some O
other O
country. O

Under O
such O
circumstances, O
however, O

he O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
proof O
against O
the O
temptation O
of O
immediate O
relief. O

They O
met O
several O
times, O
for O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
discussed. O

Wickham B-Person
of O
course O
wanted O
more O
than O
he O
could O
get; O

but O
at O
length O
was O
reduced O
to O
be O
reasonable. O

Every O
thing O
being O
settled O
between O
them, O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
's O
next O
step O
was O
to O

make O
your O
uncle O
acquainted O
with O
it, O

and O
he O
first O
called O
in O
Gracechurch B-Location
street I-Location

the O
evening O
before O
I O
came O
home. O

But O
Mr. O
Gardiner B-Person
could O
not O
be O
seen, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
found, O

on O
further O
enquiry, O
that O
your O
father O
was O
still O
with O
him, O

but O
would O
quit O
town O
the O
next O
morning. O

He O
did O
not O
judge O
your O
father O
to O
be O
a O
person O

whom O
he O
could O
so O
properly O
consult O
as O
your O
uncle, O

and O
therefore O
readily O
postponed O
seeing O
him O
till O

after O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
former. O

He O
did O
not O
leave O
his O
name, O

and O
till O
the O
next O
day O
it O
was O
only O
known O
that O
a O
gentleman O

had O
called O
on O
business. O

On O
Saturday O
he O
came O
again. O

Your O
father O
was O
gone, O
your O
uncle O
at O
home, O
and, O
as O
I O
said O
before, O

they O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
talk O
together. O

They O
met O
again O
on O
Sunday, O
and O
then O
I O
saw O
him O
too. O

It O
was O
not O
all O
settled O
before O
Monday: O

as O
soon O
as O
it O
was, O
the O
express O
was O
sent O
off O
to O
Longbourn B-Location
. O

But O
our O
visitor O
was O
very O
obstinate. O

I O
fancy, O
Lizzy B-Person
, O
that O
obstinacy O
is O
the O
real O
defect O
of O
his O
character, O

after O
all. O

He O
has O
been O
accused O
of O
many O
faults O
at O
different O
times, O

but O
this O
is O
the O
true O
one. O

Nothing O
was O
to O
be O
done O
that O
he O
did O
not O
do O
himself; O

though O
I O
am O
sure O
(and O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
it O
to O
be O
thanked, O

therefore O
say O
nothing O
about O
it), O

your O
uncle O
would O
most O
readily O
have O
settled O
the O
whole. O

They O
battled O
it O
together O
for O
a O
long O
time, O

which O
was O
more O
than O
either O
the O
gentleman O
or O
lady O
concerned O
in O
it O
deserved. O

But O
at O
last O
your O
uncle O
was O
forced O
to O
yield, O

and O
instead O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
be O
of O
use O
to O
his O
niece, O

was O
forced O
to O
put O
up O
with O
only O
having O
the O
probable O
credit O
of O
it, O

which O
went O
sorely O
against O
the O
grain; O

and O
I O
really O
believe O
your O
letter O
this O
morning O
gave O
him O
great O
pleasure, O

because O
it O
required O
an O
explanation O

that O
would O
rob O
him O
of O
his O
borrowed O
feathers, O

and O
give O
the O
praise O
where O
it O
was O
due. O

But, O
Lizzy B-Person
, O
this O
must O
go O
no O
farther O
than O
yourself, O
or O
Jane B-Person
at O
most. O

You O
know O
pretty O
well, O
I O
suppose, O
what O
has O
been O
done O
for O
the O
young O
people. O

His O
debts O
are O
to O
be O
paid, O
amounting, O

I O
believe, O
to O
considerably O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
pounds, O

another O
thousand O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
own O
settled O
upon O
her, O

and O
his O
commission O
purchased. O

The O
reason O
why O
all O
this O
was O
to O
be O
done O
by O
him O
alone, O

was O
such O
as O
I O
have O
given O
above. O

It O
was O
owing O
to O
him, O
to O
his O
reserve O
and O
want O
of O
proper O
consideration, O

that O
Wickham B-Person
's O
character O
had O
been O
so O
misunderstood, O

and O
consequently O
that O
he O
had O
been O
received O
and O
noticed O
as O
he O
was. O

Perhaps O
there O
was O
some O
truth O
in O
this; O

though O
I O
doubt O
whether O
his O
reserve, O

or O
anybody'sreserve, O
can O
be O
answerable O
for O
the O
event. O

But O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
this O
fine O
talking, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy B-Person
, O

you O
may O
rest O
perfectly O
assured O
that O
your O
uncle O
would O
never O
have O
yielded, O

if O
we O
had O
not O
given O
him O
credit O
for O
another O
interest O
in O
the O
affair. O

When O
all O
this O
was O
resolved O
on, O
he O
returned O
again O
to O
his O
friends, O

who O
were O
still O
staying O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
; O

but O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
he O
should O
be O
in O
London B-Location

once O
more O
when O
the O
wedding O
took O
place, O

and O
all O
money O
matters O
were O
then O
to O
receive O
the O
last O
finish. O

I O
believe O
I O
have O
now O
told O
you O
every O
thing. O

It O
is O
a O
relation O
which O
you O
tell O
me O
is O
to O
give O
you O
great O
surprise; O

I O
hope O
at O
least O
it O
will O
not O
afford O
you O
any O
displeasure. O

Lydia B-Person
came O
to O
us; O
and O
Wickham B-Person
had O
constant O
admission O

to O
the O
house. O

He O
was O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
been O
when O
I O
knew O
him O
in O
Hertfordshire B-Location
; O

but O
I O
would O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
little O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
her O
behaviour O

while O
she O
staid O
with O
us, O

if O
I O
had O
not O
perceived, O
by O
Jane B-Person
's O
letter O
last O
Wednesday, O

that O
her O
conduct O
on O
coming O
home O
was O
exactly O
of O
a O
piece O
with O
it, O

and O
therefore O
what O
I O
now O
tell O
you O
can O
give O
you O
no O
fresh O
pain. O

I O
talked O
to O
her O
repeatedly O
in O
the O
most O
serious O
manner, O

representing O
to O
her O
all O
the O
wickedness O
of O
what O
she O
had O
done, O

and O
all O
the O
unhappiness O
she O
had O
brought O
on O
her O
family. O

If O
she O
heard O
me, O
it O
was O
by O
good O
luck, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
did O
not O
listen. O

I O
was O
sometimes O
quite O
provoked, O
but O
then O
I O
recollected O
my O
dear O
Elizabeth B-Person
and O
Jane B-Person
, O
and O
for O
their O
sakes O
had O
patience O
with O
her. O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
was O
punctual O
in O
his O
return, O
and O
as O
Lydia B-Person
informed O
you, O

attended O
the O
wedding. O

He O
dined O
with O
us O
the O
next O
day, O

and O
was O
to O
leave O
town O
again O
on O
Wednesday O
or O
Thursday. O

Will O
you O
be O
very O
angry O
with O
me, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy B-Person
, O

if O
I O
take O
this O
opportunity O
of O
saying O
(what O
I O
was O
never O
bold O
enough O
to O
say O
before) O
how O
much O
I O
like O
him. O

His O
behaviour O
to O
us O
has, O
in O
every O
respect, O
been O
as O
pleasing O
as O
when O
we O
were O
in O
Derbyshire B-Location
. O

His O
understanding O
and O
opinions O
all O
please O
me; O

he O
wants O
nothing O
but O
a O
little O
more O
liveliness, O

and O
that, O
if O
he O
marry O
prudently, O

his O
wife O
may O
teach O
him. O
I O
thought O
him O
very O
sly; O

he O
hardly O
ever O
mentioned O
your O
name. O

But O
slyness O
seems O
the O
fashion. O

Pray O
forgive O
me O
if O
I O
have O
been O
very O
presuming, O
or O
at O
least O
do O
not O
punish O
me O
so O
far O
as O
to O
exclude O
me O
from O
P. O

I O
shall O
never O
be O
quite O
happy O
till O
I O
have O
been O
all O
round O
the O
park. O

A O
low O
phaeton B-Misc
, O
with O
a O
nice O
little O
pair O
of O
ponies, O

would O
be O
the O
very O
thing. O

But O
I O
must O
write O
no O
more. O

The O
children O
have O
been O
wanting O
me O
this O
half O
hour. O
Your's, O
very O
sincerely, O

M. O
GARDINER B-Person
." O

The O
contents O
of O
this O
letter O
threw O
Elizabeth B-Person
into O
a O
flutter O
of O
spirits, O

in O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
determine O
whether O
pleasure O
or O
pain O

bore O
the O
greatest O
share. O

The O
vague O
and O
unsettled O
suspicions O
which O
uncertainty O
had O
produced O
of O
what O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
might O
have O
been O
doing O
to O
forward O
her O
sister's O
match, O

which O
she O
had O
feared O
to O
encourage O
as O
an O
exertion O
of O
goodness O
too O
great O
to O

be O
probable, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
dreaded O
to O
be O
just, O

from O
the O
pain O
of O
obligation, O

were O
proved O
beyond O
their O
greatest O
extent O
to O
be O
true! O

He O
had O
followed O
them O
purposely O
to O
town, O
h O

e O
had O
taken O
on O
himself O
all O
the O
trouble O
and O
mortification O
attendant O

on O
such O
a O
research; O

in O
which O
supplication O
had O
been O
necessary O
to O
a O
woman O

whom O
he O
must O
abominate O
and O
despise, O

and O
where O
he O
was O
reduced O
to O
meet, O
frequently O
meet, O
reason O
with, O

persuade, O
and O
finally O
bribe, O
the O
man O
whom O
he O
always O
most O
wished O
to O
avoid, O

and O
whose O
very O
name O
it O
was O
punishment O
to O
him O
to O
pronounce. O

He O
had O
done O
all O
this O
for O
a O
girl O
whom O
he O
could O
neither O
regard O
nor O
esteem. O

Her O
heart O
did O
whisper O
that O
he O
had O
done O
it O
for O
her. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
hope O
shortly O
checked O
by O
other O
considerations, O

and O
she O
soon O
felt O
that O
even O
her O
vanity O
was O
insufficient, O

when O
required O
to O
depend O
on O
his O
affection O
for O
her O
-- O

for O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
already O
refused O
him O
-- O

as O
able O
to O
overcome O
a O
sentiment O
so O
natural O
as O
abhorrence O
against O
relationship O
with O
Wickham B-Person
. O
Brother-in-law O
of O
Wickham B-Person
! O
Every O
kind O
of O
pride O
must O
revolt O
from O
the O
connection. O

He O
had, O
to O
be O
sure, O
done O
much. O

She O
was O
ashamed O
to O
think O
how O
much. O

But O
he O
had O
given O
a O
reason O
for O
his O
interference, O

which O
asked O
no O
extraordinary O
stretch O
of O
belief. O

It O
was O
reasonable O
that O
he O
should O
feel O
he O
had O
been O
wrong; O

he O
had O
liberality, O
and O
he O
had O
the O
means O
of O
exercising O
it; O

and O
though O
she O
would O
not O
place O
herself O
as O
his O
principal O
inducement, O

she O
could, O
perhaps, O
believe O
that O
remaining O
partiality O
for O

her O
might O
assist O
his O
endeavours O
in O
a O
cause O
where O
her O
peace O
of O
mind O
must O
be O
materially O
concerned. O

It O
was O
painful, O
exceedingly O
painful, O

to O
know O
that O
they O
were O
under O
obligations O
to O
a O
person O
who O
could O
never O

receive O
a O
return. O

They O
owed O
the O
restoration O
of O
Lydia B-Person
, O
her O
character, O

every O
thing, O
to O
him. O

Oh! O
how O
heartily O
did O
she O
grieve O
over O
every O
ungracious O
sensation O

she O
had O
ever O
encouraged, O

every O
saucy O
speech O
she O
had O
ever O
directed O
towards O
him. O

For O
herself O
she O
was O
humbled; O

but O
she O
was O
proud O
of O
him. O
Proud O
that O
in O
a O
cause O
of O
compassion O
and O
honour, O

he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
get O
the O
better O
of O
himself. O

She O
read O
over O
her O
aunt's O
commendation O
of O
him O
again O
and O
again. O

It O
was O
hardly O
enough; O
but O
it O
pleased O
her. O

She O
was O
even O
sensible O
of O
some O
pleasure, O
though O
mixed O
with O
regret, O

on O
finding O
how O
steadfastly O
both O
she O
and O
her O
uncle O
had O
been O
persuaded O
that O

affection O
and O
confidence O
subsisted O
between O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
and O
herself. O

She O
was O
roused O
from O
her O
seat, O
and O
her O
reflections, O
by O
some O
one's O
approach; O

and O
before O
she O
could O
strike O
into O
another O
path, O

she O
was O
overtaken O
by O
Wickham B-Person
. O

"I O
am O
afraid O
I O
interrupt O
your O
solitary O
ramble, O
my O
dear O
sister?" O
said O
he, O

as O
he O
joined O
her. O

"You O
certainly O
do," O
she O
replied O
with O
a O
smile; O
" O

but O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
that O
the O
interruption O
must O
be O
unwelcome." O

"I O
should O
be O
sorry O
indeed, O
if O
it O
were. O

We O
were O
always O
good O
friends; O
and O
now O
we O
are O
better." O

"True. O
Are O
the O
others O
coming O
out?" O

"I O
do O
not O
know. O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
and O
Lydia B-Person
are O
going O
in O
the O
carriage B-Misc
to O
Meryton B-Location
. O
And O
so, O
my O
dear O
sister, O

I O
find, O
from O
our O
uncle O
and O
aunt, O

that O
you O
have O
actually O
seen O
Pemberley B-Location
." O

She O
replied O
in O
the O
affirmative. O

"I O
almost O
envy O
you O
the O
pleasure, O
and O
yet O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
me, O
or O
else O
I O
could O
take O
it O
in O
my O
way O
to O
Newcastle B-Location
. O

And O
you O
saw O
the O
old O
housekeeper, O
I O
suppose? O
Poor O
Reynolds B-Person
, O

she O
was O
always O
very O
fond O
of O
me. O

But O
of O
course O
she O
did O
not O
mention O
my O
name O
to O
you." O

"Yes, O
she O
did." O

"And O
what O
did O
she O
say?" O

"That O
you O
were O
gone O
into O
the O
army, O
and O
she O
was O
afraid O
had O

not O
turned O
out O
well. O

At O
such O
a O
distance O
as O
that, O
you O
know, O
things O
are O
strangely O
misrepresented." O

"Certainly," O
he O
replied, O
biting O
his O
lips. O
Elizabeth B-Person
hoped O
she O

had O
silenced O
him; O
but O
he O
soon O
afterwards O
said, O

"I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
Darcy B-Person
in O
town O
last O
month. O

We O
passed O
each O
other O
several O
times. O
I O
wonder O
what O
he O
can O
be O
doing O
there." O

"Perhaps O
preparing O
for O
his O
marriage O
with O
Miss O
de B-Person
Bourgh I-Person
," O

said O
Elizabeth B-Person
. O
"It O
must O
be O
something O
particular, O

to O
take O
him O
there O
at O
this O
time O
of O
year." O

"Undoubtedly. O
Did O
you O
see O
him O
while O
you O
were O
at O
Lambton B-Location
? O

I O
thought O
I O
understood O
from O
the O
Gardiner B-Person
s O
that O
you O
had." O

"Yes; O
he O
introduced O
us O
to O
his O
sister." O

"And O
do O
you O
like O
her?" O

"Very O
much." O

"I O
have O
heard, O
indeed, O

that O
she O
is O
uncommonly O
improved O
within O
this O
year O
or O
two. O

When O
I O
last O
saw O
her, O
she O
was O
not O
very O
promising. O

I O
am O
very O
glad O
you O
liked O
her. O
I O
hope O
she O
will O
turn O
out O
well." O

"I O
dare O
say O
she O
will; O
she O
has O
got O
over O
the O
most O
trying O
age." O

"Did O
you O
go O
by O
the O
village O
of O
Kympton B-Location
?" O

"I O
do O
not O
recollect O
that O
we O
did." O

"I O
mention O
it, O
because O
it O
is O
the O
living O
which O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
had. O

A O
most O
delightful O
place! O
-- O
Excellent O
Parsonage O
House! O

It O
would O
have O
suited O
me O
in O
every O
respect." O

"How O
should O
you O
have O
liked O
making O
sermons?" O

"Exceedingly O
well. O
I O
should O
have O
considered O
it O
as O
part O
of O
my O
duty, O
and O
the O
exertion O
would O
soon O
have O
been O
nothing. O
One O
ought O
not O
to O
repine; O
-- O
but, O
to O
be O
sure, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
such O
a O
thing O
for O
me! O

The O
quiet, O
the O
retirement O
of O
such O
a O
life O
would O
have O
answered O
all O
my O
ideas O

of O
happiness! O
But O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be. O

Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
Darcy B-Person
mention O
the O
circumstance, O

when O
you O
were O
in O
Kent B-Location
?" O

"I O
have O
heard O
from O
authority, O
which O
I O
thought O
as O
good, O
that O
it O
was O
left O
you O
conditionally O
only, O
and O
at O
the O
will O
of O
the O
present O
patron." O

"You O
have. O
Yes, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
that; O
I O
told O
you O
so O
from O
the O
first, O
you O
may O
remember." O

"I O
did O
hear, O
too, O
that O
there O
was O
a O
time, O
when O
sermon-making O
was O
not O
so O
palatable O
to O
you O
as O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
at O
present; O
that O
you O
actually O
declared O
your O
resolution O
of O
never O
taking O
orders, O
and O
that O
the O
business O
had O
been O
compromised O
accordingly." O

"You O
did! O
and O
it O
was O
not O
wholly O
without O
foundation. O
You O
may O
remember O
what O
I O
told O
you O
on O
that O
point, O
when O
first O
we O
talked O
of O
it." O

They O
were O
now O
almost O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
house, O
for O
she O
had O
walked O
fast O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him; O
and O
unwilling, O
for O
her O
sister's O
sake, O
to O
provoke O
him, O
she O
only O
said O
in O
reply, O
with O
a O
good-humoured O
smile, O

"Come, O
Mr. O
Wickham B-Person
, O
we O
are O
brother O
and O
sister, O
you O
know. O
Do O
not O
let O
us O
quarrel O
about O
the O
past. O
In O
future, O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
be O
always O
of O
one O
mind." O

WITHIN O
a O
short O
walk O
of O
Longbourn B-Location
lived O
a O
family O
with O

whom O
the O
Bennets O
were O
particularly O
intimate. O

Sir O
William B-Person
had O
been O
formerly O
in O
trade O
in O
Meryton B-Location
, O

where O
he O
had O
made O
a O
tolerable O
fortune O
and O
risen O
to O
the O
honour O
of O

knighthood O
by O
an O
address O
to O
the O
King O
during O
his O
mayoralty. O

The O
distinction O
had O
perhaps O
been O
felt O
too O
strongly. O

It O
had O
given O
him O
a O
disgust O
to O
his O
business O
and O
to O
his O
residence O

in O
a O
small O
market O
town; O
and O
quitting O
them O
both, O

he O
had O
removed O
with O
his O
family O
to O
a O
house O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
Meryton B-Location
, O
denominated O
from O
that O
period O
Lucas B-Location
Lodge I-Location
, O

where O
he O
could O
think O
with O
pleasure O
of O
his O
own O
importance, O

and, O
unshackled O
by O
business, O

occupy O
himself O
solely O
in O
being O
civil O
to O
all O
the O
world. O

For O
though O
elated O
by O
his O
rank, O
it O
did O
not O
render O
him O
supercilious; O

on O
the O
contrary, O
he O
was O
all O
attention O
to O
every O
body. O

By O
nature O
inoffensive, O
friendly O
and O
obliging, O

his O
presentation O
at O
St. O
James B-Person
's O
had O
made O
him O
courteous. O

Lady O
Lucas B-Person
was O
a O
very O
good O
kind O
of O
woman, O

not O
too O
clever O
to O
be O
a O
valuable O
neighbour O
to O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
. O

They O
had O
several O
children. O

The O
eldest O
of O
them, O
a O
sensible, O
intelligent O
young O
woman, O
about O
twenty-seven, O

was O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
intimate O
friend. O

That O
the O
Miss O
Lucas B-Person
es O
and O
the O
Miss O
Bennet B-Person
s O
should O
meet O
to O
talk O
over O
a O
ball O
was O
absolutely O
necessary; O

and O
the O
morning O
after O
the O
assembly O
brought O
the O
former O
to O
Longbourn B-Location

to O
hear O
and O
to O
communicate. O

"You O
began O
the O
evening O
well, O
Charlotte B-Person
," O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person

with O
civil O
self-command O
to O
Miss O
Lucas B-Person
. O
" O

You O
were O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
's O
first O
choice." O

"Yes; O
-- O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
like O
his O
second O
better." O

"Oh! O
-- O
you O
mean O
Jane B-Person
, O
I O
suppose O
-- O
because O
he O
danced O
with O
her O
twice. O
To O
be O
sure O
that O
did O
seem O
as O
if O
he O
admired O
her O
-- O
indeed O
I O
rather O
believe O
he O
did O
-- O
I O
heard O
something O
about O
it O
-- O
but O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
-- O
something O
about O
Mr. O
Robinson B-Person
." O

"Perhaps O
you O
mean O
what O
I O
overheard O
between O
him O
and O
Mr. O
Robinson B-Person
; O
did O
not O
I O
mention O
it O
to O
you? O
Mr. O
Robinson B-Person
's O
asking O
him O
how O

he O
liked O
our O
Meryton B-Location
assemblies, O

and O
whether O
he O
did O
not O
think O
there O
were O
a O
great O
many O
pretty O
women O

in O
the O
room, O
and O
which O
he O
thought O
the O
prettiest? O

and O
his O
answering O
immediately O
to O
the O
last O
question O

"Oh! O
the O
eldest O
Miss O
Bennet B-Person
beyond O
a O
doubt, O

there O
cannot O
be O
two O
opinions O
on O
that O
point."" O

"Upon O
my O
word! O
-- O
Well, O
that O
was O
very O
decided O
indeed O

that O
does O
seem O
as O
if O
-- O
but, O
however, O
it O
may O
all O
come O
to O
nothing, O
you O
know." O

"My O
overhearings O
were O
more O
to O
the O
purpose O
than O
yours, O
Eliza B-Person
," O

said O
Charlotte B-Person
. O
"Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
is O
not O
so O
well O
worth O
listening O
to O

as O
his O
friend, O
is O
he? O
-- O
Poor O
Eliza B-Person
! O
-- O
to O
be O
only O
just O
tolerable." O

"I O
beg O
you O
would O
not O
put O
it O
into O
Lizzy B-Person
's O
head O
to O
be O
vexed O
by O

his O
ill-treatment; O
for O
he O
is O
such O
a O
disagreeable O
man O
that O
it O
would O
be O
quite O
a O

misfortune O
to O
be O
liked O
by O
him. O

Mrs. O
Long B-Person
told O
me O
last O
night O
that O
he O
sat O
close O
to O
her O
for O

half O
an O
hour O
without O
once O
opening O
his O
lips." O

"Are O
you O
quite O
sure, O
Ma'am? O
-- O
is O
not O
there O
a O
little O
mistake?" O

said O
Jane B-Person
. O
-- O
"I O
certainly O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
speaking O
to O
her." O

"Aye O
-- O
because O
she O
asked O
him O
at O
last O
how O
he O
liked O
Netherfield B-Location
, O

and O
he O
could O
not O
help O
answering O
her; O

but O
she O
said O
he O
seemed O
very O
angry O
at O
being O
spoke O
to." O

"Miss O
Bingley B-Person
told O
me," O
said O
Jane B-Person
, O

"that O
he O
never O
speaks O
much O
unless O
among O
his O
intimate O
acquaintance. O

With O
them O
he O
is O
remarkably O
agreeable." O

"I O
do O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
it, O
my O
dear. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
so O
very O
agreeable, O

he O
would O
have O
talked O
to O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
. O

But O
I O
can O
guess O
how O
it O
was; O
every O
body O
says O
that O
he O
is O
ate O
up O
with O
pride, O

and O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
had O
heard O
somehow O
that O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person

does O
not O
keep O
a O
carriage, O
and O
had O
come O
to O
the O
ball O
in O
a O
hack O
chaise." O

"I O
do O
not O
mind O
his O
not O
talking O
to O
Mrs. O
Long B-Person
," O

said O
Miss O
Lucas B-Person
, O
"but O
I O
wish O
he O
had O
danced O
with O
Eliza B-Person
." O

"Another O
time, O
Lizzy B-Person
," O
said O
her O
mother, O

"I O
would O
not O
dance O
with O
him, O
if O
I O
were O
you." O

"I O
believe, O
Ma'am, O
I O
may O
safely O
promise O
you O
never O
to O
dance O
with O
him." O

"His O
pride," O
said O
Miss O
Lucas B-Person
, O

"does O
not O
offend O
me O
so O
much O
as O
pride O
often O
does, O

because O
there O
is O
an O
excuse O
for O
it. O

One O
cannot O
wonder O
that O
so O
very O
fine O
a O
young O
man, O
with O
family, O
fortune, O
every O
thing O
in O
his O
favour, O
should O
think O
highly O
of O
himself. O
If O
I O
may O
so O
express O
it, O
he O
has O
a O
right O
to O
be O
proud." O

"That O
is O
very O
true," O
replied O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
" O

and O
I O
could O
easily O
forgive O
his O
pride, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
mortified O
mine." O

"Pride," O
observed O
Mary B-Person
, O

who O
piqued O
herself O
upon O
the O
solidity O
of O
her O
reflections, O

"is O
a O
very O
common O
failing O
I O
believe. O

By O
all O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
read, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
it O
is O
very O
common O
indeed, O

that O
human O
nature O
is O
particularly O
prone O
to O
it, O
and O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O

of O
us O
who O
do O
not O
cherish O
a O
feeling O
of O
self-complacency O

on O
the O
score O
of O
some O
quality O
or O
other, O
real O
or O
imaginary. O

Vanity O
and O
pride O
are O
different O
things, O

though O
the O
words O
are O
often O
used O
synonimously. O

A O
person O
may O
be O
proud O
without O
being O
vain. O

Pride O
relates O
more O
to O
our O
opinion O
of O
ourselves, O
vanity O
to O
what O
we O
would O
have O
others O
think O
of O
us." O

"If O
I O
were O
as O
rich O
as O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
," O

cried O
a O
young O
Lucas B-Person
who O
came O
with O
his O
sisters, O

"I O
should O
not O
care O
how O
proud O
I O
was. O

I O
would O
keep O
a O
pack O
of O
foxhounds, O
and O
drink O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
every O
day." O

"Then O
you O
would O
drink O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
than O
you O
ought," O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
; O
"and O
if O
I O
were O
to O
see O
you O
at O
it, O
I O
should O
take O
away O
your O
bottle O
directly." O

The O
boy O
protested O
that O
she O
should O
not; O
she O
continued O
to O
declare O
that O
she O
would, O
and O
the O
argument O
ended O
only O
with O
the O
visit. O


THE O
day O
passed O
much O
as O
the O
day O
before O
had O
done. O
Mrs. O
Hurst B-Person
and O

Miss O
Bingley B-Person
had O
spent O
some O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
with O
the O
invalid, O

who O
continued, O
though O
slowly, O
to O
mend; O

and O
in O
the O
evening O
Elizabeth B-Person
joined O
their O
party O
in O
the O
drawing O
room. O

The O
loo O
table, O
however, O
did O
not O
appear. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
was O
writing, O
and O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
, O
seated O
near O
him, O

was O
watching O
the O
progress O
of O
his O
letter, O

and O
repeatedly O
calling O
off O
his O
attention O
by O
messages O
to O
his O
sister. O

Mr. O
Hurst B-Person
and O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
were O
at O
piquet B-Misc
, O

and O
Mrs. O
Hurst B-Person
was O
observing O
their O
game. O

Elizabeth B-Person
took O
up O
some O
needlework, O

and O
was O
sufficiently O
amused O
in O
attending O
to O
what O
passed O
between O
Darcy B-Person
and O
his O
companion. O

The O
perpetual O
commendations O
of O
the O
lady O
either O
on O
his O
hand-writing, O

or O
on O
the O
evenness O
of O
his O
lines, O
or O
on O
the O
length O
of O
his O
letter, O

with O
the O
perfect O
unconcern O
with O
which O
her O
praises O
were O
received, O

formed O
a O
curious O
dialogue, O

and O
was O
exactly O
in O
unison O
with O
her O
opinion O
of O
each. O

"How O
delighted O
Miss O
Darcy B-Person
will O
be O
to O
receive O
such O
a O
letter!" O

Tell O
your O
sister O
I O
am O
delighted O
to O
hear O
of O
her O
improvement O
on O
the O
harp B-Misc
, O
and O
pray O
let O
her O
know O
that O
I O
am O
quite O
in O
raptures O
with O
her O
beautiful O
little O

design O
for O
a O
table, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
infinitely O
superior O
to O
Miss O
Grantley B-Person
's." O

"Will O
you O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
defer O
your O
raptures O
till O
I O
write O
again? O

At O
present O
I O
have O
not O
room O
to O
do O
them O
justice." O

"Oh! O
it O
is O
of O
no O
consequence. O
I O
shall O
see O
her O
in O
January. O

But O
do O
you O
always O
write O
such O
charming O
long O
letters O
to O
her, O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
?" O

"They O
are O
generally O
long; O
but O
whether O
always O
charming, O

it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
determine." O

"It O
is O
a O
rule O
with O
me, O
that O
a O
person O
who O
can O
write O
a O
long O
letter, O

with O
ease, O
cannot O
write O
ill." O

"That O
will O
not O
do O
for O
a O
compliment O
to O
Darcy B-Person
, O
Caroline B-Person
," O

cried O
her O
brother O
-- O
"because O
he O
does O
not O
write O
with O
ease. O

He O
studies O
too O
much O
for O
words O
of O
four O
syllables. O
-- O
Do O
not O
you, O
Darcy B-Person
?" O

"My O
stile O
of O
writing O
is O
very O
different O
from O
yours." O

"Oh!" O
cried O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
, O
"Charles O
writes O
in O
the O
most O
careless O
way O

imaginable. O
He O
leaves O
out O
half O
his O
words, O
and O
blots O
the O
rest." O

"My O
ideas O
flow O
so O
rapidly O
that O
I O
have O
not O
time O
to O
express O
them O
-- O
by O
which O

means O
my O
letters O
sometimes O
convey O
no O
ideas O
at O
all O
to O
my O
correspondents." O

"Your O
humility, O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
," O
said O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O

"Nothing O
is O
more O
deceitful," O
said O
Darcy B-Person
, O
" O

than O
the O
appearance O
of O
humility. O

"And O
which O
of O
the O
two O
do O
you O
call O
my O
little O
recent O
piece O
of O
modesty?" O

"The O
indirect O
boast; O
-- O
for O
you O
are O
really O
proud O
of O
your O
defects O
in O
writing, O

because O
you O
consider O
them O
as O
proceeding O
from O
a O
rapidity O
of O
thought O
and O

carelessness O
of O
execution, O
which O
if O
not O
estimable, O

you O
think O
at O
least O
highly O
interesting. O
The O
power O
of O
doing O
any O
thing O
with O

quickness O
is O
always O
much O
prized O
by O
the O
possessor, O
and O
often O
without O
any O

attention O
to O
the O
imperfection O
of O
the O
performance. O

When O
you O
told O
Mrs. O
Bennet B-Person
this O
morning O
that O
if O
you O
ever O
resolved O
on O

quitting O
Netherfield B-Location
you O
should O
be O
gone O
in O
five O
minutes, O

you O
meant O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sort O
of O
panegyric, O
of O
compliment O
to O
yourself O

and O
yet O
what O
is O
there O
so O
very O
laudable O
in O
a O
precipitance O
which O
must O
leave O
very O
necessary O
business O
undone, O
and O
can O
be O
of O
no O
real O
advantage O
to O
yourself O
or O
any O
one O
else?" O

"Nay," O
cried O
Bingley B-Person
, O
"this O
is O
too O
much, O
to O
remember O
at O
night O
all O
the O

foolish O
things O
that O
were O
said O
in O
the O
morning. O
And O
yet, O
upon O
my O
honour, O

I O
believed O
what O
I O
said O
of O
myself O
to O
be O
true, O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
at O
this O
moment. O

At O
least, O
therefore, O
I O
did O
not O
assume O
the O
character O
of O
needless O
precipitance O

merely O
to O
shew O
off O
before O
the O
ladies." O

"I O
dare O
say O
you O
believed O
it; O
but O
I O
am O
by O
no O
means O
convinced O
that O
you O
would O
be O
gone O
with O
such O
celerity. O
Your O
conduct O
would O
be O
quite O
as O
dependant O
on O
chance O
as O
that O
of O
any O
man O
I O
know; O
and O
if, O
as O
you O
were O
mounting O
your O
horse B-Misc
, O

a O
friend O
were O
to O
say, O
" O
Bingley B-Person
, O
you O
had O
better O
stay O
till O
next O
week," O

you O
would O
probably O
do O
it, O
you O
would O
probably O
not O
go O
-- O
and, O
at O
another O
word, O
might O
stay O
a O
month." O

"You O
have O
only O
proved O
by O
this," O
cried O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
"that O
Mr. O
Bingley B-Person
did O
not O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
own O
disposition. O

"Upon O
my O
word O
I O
cannot O
exactly O
explain O
the O
matter; O
Darcy B-Person
must O
speak O

for O
himself." O

"You O
expect O
me O
to O
account O
for O
opinions O
which O
you O
chuse O
to O
call O
mine, O

but O
which O
I O
have O
never O
acknowledged. O

Allowing O
the O
case, O
however, O
to O
stand O
according O
to O
your O
representation, O

you O
must O
remember, O
Miss O
Bennet B-Person
, O
that O
the O
friend O
who O
is O
supposed O
to O

desire O
his O
return O
to O
the O
house, O
and O
the O
delay O
of O
his O
plan, O

has O
merely O
desired O
it, O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
took O
her O
advice, O
and O
did O
finish O
his O
letter. O

When O
that O
business O
was O
over, O
he O
applied O
to O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
and O
Elizabeth B-Person
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
some O
music. O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
moved O
with O

alacrity O
to O
the O
piano B-Misc
forte I-Misc
, O
and O
after O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
Elizabeth B-Person
would O
lead O
the O
way, O
which O
the O
other O
as O
politely O
and O
more O
earnestly O
negatived, O
she O
seated O
herself. O

Mrs. O
Hurst B-Person
sang O
with O
her O
sister, O
and O
while O
they O
were O
thus O
employed, O

Elizabeth B-Person
could O
not O
help O
observing, O

as O
she O
turned O
over O
some O
music O
books O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
instrument, O

how O
frequently O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
's O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
her. O

After O
playing O
some O
Italian O
songs, O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
varied O
the O
charm O
by O
a O

lively O
Scotch O
air; O
and O
soon O
afterwards O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O
drawing O
near O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
said O
to O
her O
-- O

She O
often O
tried O
to O
provoke O
Darcy B-Person
into O
disliking O
her O
guest, O
by O
talking O
of O
their O
supposed O
marriage, O
and O
planning O
his O
happiness O
in O
such O
an O
alliance. O

"I O
hope," O
said O
she, O
as O
they O
were O
walking O
together O
in O
the O
shrubbery B-Location

the O
next O
day, O
"you O
will O
give O
your O
mother-in-law O
a O
few O
hints, O

when O
this O
desirable O
event O
takes O
place, O

as O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
holding O
her O
tongue; O

and O
if O
you O
can O
compass O
it, O
do O
cure O
the O
younger O
girls O
of O
running O
after O
the O

officers. O
-- O
And, O
if O
I O
may O
mention O
so O
delicate O
a O
subject, O

endeavour O
to O
check O
that O
little O
something, O
b O

ordering O
on O
conceit O
and O
impertinence, O
which O
your O
lady O
possesses." O

"Have O
you O
any O
thing O
else O
to O
propose O
for O
my O
domestic O
felicity?" O

"Oh! O
yes. O
-- O
Do O
let O
the O
portraits O
of O
your O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
Philips B-Person
be O

placed O
in O
the O
gallery O
at O
Pemberley B-Location
. O
Put O
them O
next O
to O
your O
great O
uncle, O
the O
judge. O
They O
are O
in O
the O
same O
profession, O
you O
know; O
only O
in O
different O
lines. O

As O
for O
your O
Elizabeth B-Person
's O
picture, O
you O
must O
not O
attempt O
to O
have O
it O
taken, O

for O
what O
painter O
could O
do O
justice O
to O
those O
beautiful O
eyes?" O

"It O
would O
not O
be O
easy, O
indeed, O
to O
catch O
their O
expression, O
but O
their O
colour O
and O
shape, O
and O
the O
eye-lashes, O
so O
remarkably O
fine, O
might O
be O
copied." O

At O
that O
moment O
they O
were O
met O
from O
another O
walk, O

by O
Mrs. O
Hurst B-Person
and O
Elizabeth B-Person
herself. O

"I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
you O
intended O
to O
walk," O

said O
Miss O
Bingley B-Person
, O
in O
some O
confusion, O
lest O
they O
had O
been O
overheard. O

"You O
used O
us O
abominably O
ill," O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hurst B-Person
, O

"in O
running O
away O
without O
telling O
us O
that O
you O
were O
coming O
out." O

Then O
taking O
the O
disengaged O
arm O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
, O
she O
left O
Elizabeth B-Person

to O
walk O
by O
herself. O
The O
path O
just O
admitted O
three. O

Mr. O
Darcy B-Person
felt O
their O
rudeness O
and O
immediately O
said, O
-- O

"This O
walk O
is O
not O
wide O
enough O
for O
our O
party. O
We O
had O
better O
go O
into O
the O
avenue B-Location
." O

But O
Elizabeth B-Person
, O
who O
had O
not O
the O
least O
inclination O
to O
remain O
with O
them, O
laughingly O
answered, O

"No, O
no; O
stay O
where O
you O
are. O
-- O
You O
are O
charmingly O
group'd, O
and O
appear O
to O
uncommon O
advantage. O
The O
picturesque O
would O
be O
spoilt O
by O
admitting O
a O
fourth. O
Good O
bye." O

She O
then O
ran O
gaily O
off, O
rejoicing, O
as O
she O
rambled O
about, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
at O
home O
again O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two. O
Jane B-Person
was O
already O
so O
much O
recovered O
as O
to O
intend O
leaving O
her O
room O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
that O
evening. O
